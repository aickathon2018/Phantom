# About GrabWear

We are here to create a solution to reduce solid waste and hence solve the environmental
crisis problem of toxic chemical usage, water pollution and land fill contribution caused by
textile waste. We're Grab for Fashion!


### How?

By facilitating a clothing donation, exchange, purchase and lending platform while taking in account of Fit, Fabric and Style.

### What?

A fashion sharing platform that intelligently matches the needs and wants of users with the existing library of garments. Features Smart sorting and categorization upload system that automagically categorizes clothing based on colors, styles, and garments identified using [Coqnitics](http://coqnitics.com) in the image uploaded.

### Who?

People in need and indeed (Donation to victims, orphanage, old folks home, low income families, homeless shelters, and also fast fashion users!)

### Why?

Sustainability and accessibility. Economics, ecological, moral impacts in an engaging and informative way.
